# 📐 Data Modeling – Bookstore Dashboard

## 🔹 Overview
This data model is designed for a simple and efficient Power BI dashboard that analyzes book sales and author performance.  
It uses a star-like structure with one central fact table and a supporting dimension table.

---

## 🔹 Tables

### Fact table
**`books_clean_with_authors_ids_sales`**  
Contains book-level records used for analysis:
- `book_id` (primary key)  
- `title`  
- `price`  
- `sales_units`  
- `rating`  
- `author_id` (foreign key to authors)

### Dimension table
**`authors`**  
Contains author metadata:
- `author_id` (primary key)  
- `author_name`

---

## 🔹 Relationship
- `authors[author_id]` → `books_clean_with_authors_ids_sales[author_id]`  
  (One author → many books. Each book → one author.)

---

## 🔹 Why this design?
- **Simple & fast**: calculations (DAX) are easier and queries run faster.  
- **Scalable**: you can add more dimension tables later (e.g., `publishers`, `genres`, `date`).  
- **Business-aligned**: supports analysis at both book level (sales, revenue, price) and author level (top authors, book counts).

---

## 🔹 Quick use-cases (business questions this model answers)
- Who are the top 5 revenue-generating authors?  
- Which books are underperforming and need marketing support?  
- What is the average revenue per book by author?  
- Which authors have many titles but low total revenue?

---

# 📊 Measures & Visuals – Bookstore Dashboard

## 🔹 Measures Created

**Total Revenue**  
```DAX
Total Revenue = SUMX(
    books_clean_with_authors_ids_sales,
    books_clean_with_authors_ids_sales[price] * books_clean_with_authors_ids_sales[sales_units]
)
