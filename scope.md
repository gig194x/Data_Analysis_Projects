##  What is the Scope?
I started this project by writing the **Scope Document**.  
This scope is the first step in my work and it acts like the contract of the project.  
It defines exactly what I will do, how I will do it, and what the final outputs will be.

##  Why I Created the Scope
- To make sure I have a **clear plan** before starting.  
- To **organize all steps** of the project in the right order.  
- To keep the project focused on solving the bookstore sales problem.  
- To have a written record of **all tasks** that I need to complete.
